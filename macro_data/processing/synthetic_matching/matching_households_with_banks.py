"""Module for harmonizing household and bank financial data.

This module harmonizes financial data from different sources:
1. Household Survey Data:
   - Reported deposit holdings
   - Outstanding loan balances
   - Financial asset information
   - Debt service payments

2. Banking System Data:
   - Aggregate household deposits
   - Retail loan portfolio
   - Balance sheet totals
   - Customer account data

The harmonization process involves:
1. Data Validation:
   - Checking total deposits match across sources
   - Validating loan balances
   - Ensuring consistent customer counts

2. Data Reconciliation:
   - Scaling household deposits to match bank totals
   - Adjusting loan balances for consistency
   - Computing account distributions

3. Optimal Assignment:
   - Minimizing discrepancy between data sources
   - Preserving financial relationships
   - Recording final assignments

Note:
    This module focuses on harmonizing financial data from different sources
    to create a consistent initial state. The actual financial market dynamics
    are implemented in the simulation package.
